# Cognito Auth App

Auth application to authenticate several websites and mobile apps.

This is a serverless project using the Serverless framework(sst.dev) and authentication is based on standard JWT token using AWS Amplify and Amazon Cognito.

This app can be integrated with any application supporting oAuth2 and provides Single Sign On(SSO) on all services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure your local machine has `Node.js 16` and `npm 7` installed.

### Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

In stall in the project root, `frontend/authenticator`, and `frontend/authenticator-client`.

### Set the AWS environmental variables

```sh
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="ASIAXQxxx"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="pgs3CiM8knxxx"
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjExxx"
```

### Create cognito app client

After the first deployment, add an app client and set up the hosted UI([documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-configuring-app-integration.html))

For development purpose, you can set callback URLs as `http://localhost:3001`

Retrieve app client id and set `REACT_APP_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID` environment variable in `frontend/authenticator-client/.env`
